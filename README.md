# NeutroGeometry
This software was coded by Dr. Erick Gonz√°lez Caballero, from two book chapters to appear on the subject of Finite NeutroGeometries. Specifically, this software contains the main elements to perform Finite Geometry Planes calculations and plots. It is coded in python 3.6 language for calculations, and its Tkinter and Turtle packages for visual and graphical programming, respectively. To read both chapters it is essential to understand the theoretical basis of the software. The software is an executable application for Windows 10 or higher. It could work correctly on Windows with versions before 10.
